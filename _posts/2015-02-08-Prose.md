## Prose: the CMS-free CMS

You know already that I start this blog using Jekyll and Github. To make blogging a bit easier (starting Jekyll on Windows is a mess!) I use [Prose](http://www.prose.io "Prose"). This tool gives Github Pages an handy editor. For writting Porse is wonderfull. You create blogpost as if you are typing in Word (only this is Markdown ;) ).

I hope to blog more. Untill next time, goodbye!
