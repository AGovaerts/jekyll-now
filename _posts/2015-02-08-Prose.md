title: Prose: the CMS-free CMS
---

You know already that I start this blog using Jekyll and Github. To make blogging a bit easier (starting Jekyll on Windows is a mess!) So I decided to test [Prose](http://www.prose.io "Prose"). This tool gives Github Pages an handy editor. You create blogpost as if you are typing in Word (only this is Markdown ;) ). Conclusion after a bit of playing/testing: It is't working as I has to be. Search for a new solution...

I hope to blog more. Untill next time, goodbye!
